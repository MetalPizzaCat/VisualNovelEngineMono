#the idea behind how stuff in this project is stored is fairly simple
#yaml is used for static data written by user, like configs, speaker info, scene info
#and dialog files are used as a way to "program" a dialog, since they contain utilities for dialog jumps
#as well as value checks

#any thing in text written as $variable_name$ will be replaced with value from [variables] block

#this file is an example for the Dialog "programming" language
#comments are lines that start with # symbol
#whole line will be treated as a comment
#this creates speaker with id 0
[speaker]
#because funni
name = skull
#points to the name of the object that contains speaker info
#this object is stored in yaml
source = Skull
position = left

#speaker block does not create a brand new speaker, rather it defines how already defined speaker would work
[speaker]
name = girl
source = Girl
position = offscreen

[variables]
USERNAME = "Mieclesoft Bimbows"
AGE = 26

#these are block types
[dialog]
#this is name label
#it is used for moving around the dialog
